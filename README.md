# NYC Citibike Analysis
MODULE 14 - Citibike analysis

## OVERVIEW
### Purpose:  The purpose of the current analysis is to prepare visualizations that give potential investors a look into the highly-successful NYC Citibike bike-sharing program, so that they can see for themselves that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  Among others, we have prepared visualizations that 1) Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, 2) Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and 3) Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.


## RESOURCES
  - Source Files: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv, 201908-citibike-revised_tripdata.csv
  - Software:  Tableau, Python 3.7.6, Jupyter NB, Pandas Library

## SUMMARY
### The results of this analysis have given insight into the utilization of bicycles in the NYC Citibike bike-sharing program. We've seen the patterns of useage by time and by gender.  Utilization rates can now be predicted based on time of day and location.  Weekday useage is heavily concentrated around the morning and afternoon commute.  Weekend useage is more evenly spread through the day.  We would recommend further analysis for a few points.  Firstly, while we've seen that the vast majority of trips are 30 min or less, we should perform further analysis to compare weekend trip durations to weekday trip durations.  We should also
